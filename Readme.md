# TruckersMP Anti-AFK

This is a little AutoHotKey Script, that'll send `/p` to chat every 5 minutes.

I couldn't be bothered staying "active" in-game and moving or typing every now
and again, so I just made a small script to not have to do that myself anymore.

If you can't - or don't want to - install AHKv2, then you can also grab the
Executable from the Releasees tab.
